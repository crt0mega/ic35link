	NEWS: release info about IC35Link
	=================================

2001-08-12	version 1.18	IC35LINK-1-18
	long pending release with several improvements and corrections
	according to suggestions and bug reports by users.
	improvements:
	- improved README: table of contents, restrictions, more explanations
	- ic35mgr restore and MMC write 30% faster (proposal by Harald Becker)
	- ic35sync, ic35mgr, vcaconv now support long options, e.g. "--help"
	  info enquiry with "--help" or "--version" now returns exitcode 0
	- new autogen.sh script for generate configure etc. after CVS checkout
	  (thanks Konrad Mader for report about missing configure in CVS)
	- new configure option "--disable-logandcomsim" for conditional compile
	  without logging and com-simulation (proposal by Harald Becker)
	- new configure options "--enable-ansi" and "--enable-pedantic"
	bugfixes:
	- fixed problem where ic35sync with many (ca. 860) addresses failed
	  (thanks Konrad Mader for bug report "get_mod_flen failed")
	- ic35sync now accepts also empty PIMfile(s), e.g. empty ic35.memo
	  (thanks Malte Schmidt for bug report "ic35.memo: parse error")
	- ic35mgr MMCard functions now check ic35path before accessing IC35
	  e.g. warn if shell eat backslash (\) in unquoted MMCard1\test.txt
	  (thanks Thomas Lichtenberg for bug report)
	- restricted ic35mgr to max.blocksize 16350 found by experiments
	- ic35sync, ic35mgr now abort on open failure of logfile or simfile
	- fixed com-simulation for adjacent "RD nn" lines and non-logged bytes
	- fixed compile problem util.c with Linux Mandrake-8.0 and SuSE-7.2
	  (thanks Christian Theile, Karl Stroetmann for bug reports)
	- corrected warnings from "--enable-ansi" and "--missing-prototypes"
	- fixed all Makefile.am: maintainer-clean keeps only sources in CVS,
	  install also README and COPYING, clean dependencies and versinfo.c

2001-02-05	version 1.17	IC35LINK-1-17
	package renamed to "ic35link" and automake/autoconf/CVS reorganization.
	no changes in sources, programs are unchanged except for version.
	sources,documents now reside in src,doc subdirectories respectively.

2001-02-04	version 1.16	IC35SYNC-1-16
	this is a bugfix and redesign release and is the last named "ic35sync".
	(the package will be renamed to "ic35link" in the next release, when
	 the reorganizations for automake/autoconf and public CVS are done.)
	improvements and redesign:
	- ic35sync,ic35mgr,vcaconv now report package version and build info
	- distribution includes vcc.c to handle missing/bad 'bison' or 'yacc'
	  (e.g. SuSE-7.0's yacc produced bad vcc.o, thanks Michael Bruennert)
	- reworked and clearified the IC35 manager protocol documentation and
	  implementation (see ic35mgr.txt, mgrtrans.*, mgrproto.*), refer to
	  the IC35 SoftwareDevelopmentKit API MMCard functions in mgrproto.c
	bugfixes in ic35mgr and ic35sync:
	- fixed compile error RedHat-7.0 gcc-2.96 (thanks Dieter Schultschik)
	- corrections for 'ic35mgr status' (thanks Michael Bruennert):
	  mgrtrans.c:status() tries to get IC35 response instead of only wait
	  mgrproto.c:MMCsend() sends blocklength with initial wait
	  corrected output of MMCard2 label
	- ic35mgr commands backup and restore show error messages on new line
	- avoid failing 'ic35mgr restore ..' at "disconnect" by delay 3.25 sec
	  after writedatabase() done
	- avoid failure of 'ic35mgr mmcput file' with occasional slow IC35
	  MMCard write with 3.5 sec timeout for length of response block
	- corrected MMC closedir,closefile response PDUs having no status-word
	- corrected to make 'ic35sync status' work also with simulation file

2001-01-20	version 1.15	IC35SYNC-1-15
	new IC35 manager 'ic35mgr' supports access of IC35 MMCard(s)
	- command "mmcdir" lists contents of MMCard(s)
	- commands "mmcget","mmcput","mmcdel" read,write,delete MMCard file
	- commands "backup","restore" IC35 organizer database
	- ic35mgr.txt now really describes the IC35 manager protocol
	  (previously it was just extracts of Windows 'portmon' logfiles)
	bugfixes in ic35sync and vcaconv:
	- "ic35sync sync" now updates record if on IC35, else writes new record
	- "vcaconv sortvca ic35.vcal" did produce empty output, fixed vobject.c
	- fixed vcc.y compile warnings
	- "vcaconv sortvca .." improved: shows properties in sort order sequence
	todo:
	- ic35mgr install application on IC35
	- ic35sync initial sync does not yet write all records to IC35
	  workaround: do "ic35sync import .." before first "ic35sync sync .."

2000-12-28	version 1.14	IC35SYNC-1-14
	ic35sync import,sync step-5 done: "sync" command, misc. improvements
	- sync command for synchronize vCard,vCalendar format PIMdata with IC35
	- corrected convert of PIM BDAY birthday to IC35 for yyyy-mm-dd format
	- PIM multiple CATEGORIES now preserved by prepend category from IC35,
	  single or standard of multiple CATEGORIES are replaced
	- PIM fullname FN now preserved, IC35 updates first,last name into it
	- put first 2 EMAIL entries from vCard into IC35 address Email1,Email2
	- put unspecific telno to IC35 TelWork for "Business", else to TelHome
	- map IC35 address "(def.)"s in VCARD.NOTE marked "(def1):","(def2):"
	- conversion IC35 to/from PIM record does now yet delete record fields
	- extracted data formats from dataio.c into separate modules:
	  datatxt.c  text format (output only)
	  databin.c  binary IC35 record format
	  datavca.c  vCard,vCalendar format
	  vcutil.c   vCard,vCalendar utilities
	  vcutil.h   header for vCard,vCalendar utilities
	fixes for gnomecard from gnome-pim_1.2.0:
	- compare VCARD.REV against old reference date+time from IC35, because
	  gnomecard does not maintain X-PILOTSTAT.
	- write VCARD.REV:yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss, because yyyymmddThhmmss was
	  ignored by gnomecard.
	fixes for gnomecal from gnome-pim_1.2.0:
	- first line of VEVENT.SUMMARY to/from IC35 Summary, remaining lines
	  to/from Notes, because gnomecal does not support VEVENT.DESCRIPTION
	- keep unsupported property VTODO.DSTART marked in VTODO.DESCRIPTION
	- add VEVENT,VTODO.CLASS:PUBLIC, else gnomecal would crash on edit
	fixes for korganizer v1.1.1:
	- put UID:IC35id-xxxxxxxx to vCard,vCalender record if no UID there.
	- produce output vCard,vCal in same CRLF/NL-mode as found on input,
	  as korganizer has NL-terminated lines in vCalendar.
	- translate IC35 CRLF to/from PIM NL in NOTE and DESCRIPTION fields.
	- keep unsupported properties VTODO.DSTART,DUE,CATEGORIES as marked
	  lines in VTODO.DESCRIPTION
	- korganizer supports only DALARM, map IC35 LED and Beep to/from it
	vcaconv extensions:
	- command "prvca" reports vCard/vCalendar parse error.
	- command "sortvca" outputs sorted vCard,vCalendar to standard output.
	- command "imphandy" appends vCards with category HANDY from vCard file
	  to standard output, after import the result back into IC35 they are
	  for upload to a mobile phone from IC35 addresses in category HANDY.
	CAVEAT:
	- no options for sync conflict resolve, PIMfile always overrides IC35!
	- IC35 has no different times for LED,Beep alarm, DALARM takes priority
	- vcaconv conversions do not transfer clean/modified record status
	- memory leak in vobject.c: all setVObject_*_Value() do not free the
	  previously attached dupStr()-allocated string value

2000-12-17	version 1.13	IC35SYNC-1-13	(not released to public)
	ic35sync import,sync step-4 done: "import" command, misc. improvements
	- algorithm details described in ic35sync.c:ic35import(),ic35export()
	- import command for vCard,vCalendar or binary format PIMdata into IC35
	- status command (new) shows IC35 version, sysinfo, total,mod records
	- export command improved:
	  export into existing PIMfile(s), backup e.g. ic35vcal to ic35.vcal~
	  map IC35 address fields "(def.)" to/from VCARD:NOTE marked lines
	  change vCard,vCalendar record modified time only if record changed
	  support DCREATED in vCalendar: creation time of VEVENT,VTODO record
	  corrected VEVENT:AALARM,DLARM, were sometimes wrongly created
	- support X-PILOTSTAT in vCard,vCal: 0=same, other=changed vs. IC35
	- default format changed to "vca" for primary use vCard,vCalendar
	- vcaconv may be used as filter with input/output from stdin/stdout
	- fixed QUOTED-PRINTABLE problem with multi-field properties (like
	  VCARD:N, VCARD:ADR): due to problem with parser vcc.y and for
	  compatibility with other programs using the vCard,vCal output
	  QUOTED-PRINTABLE is not used on multi-field properties.
	  (otherwise the split into field sub-properties fails and the
	  first field (e.g. VCARD:ADR:STREET) gets the string of ALL the
	  fields (e.g. STREET,CITY,etc.) with ";" within it.)
	todo: sync command, fix memory leak in vobject.c
	  conversion IC35 to/from PIM record does not yet delete record fields,
	  i.e. record on destination may differ and have fields not in source.
	  may be delete field needed only for sync, because import/export are
	  specified to not delete on destination.

2000-12-07	version 1.12	IC35SYNC-1-12	(not released to public)
	ic35sync import,sync step-3 done:
	convert vCard,vCalendar format to IC35 record
	ic35sync import,sync step-2 done:
	new protocol functions for import,sync tested OK
	new knowledge about import,sync from experiments
	new features:
	- vcaconv supports "vca2bin", new "bin2txt" conversions
	- ic35log.sh supports new commands readrecrid,updatrec
	  processes ic35sync logfiles, fragmented response readmodrec
	- syntrans.{c,h}: connect() argument rdtime to retrieve value from IC35
	corrections:
	- corrected ic35addr_to_vcard(): set VCAdrProp if have any address field
	- vcaconv.c,dataio.c: handle binfile records without data
	- synproto.c: corrected CMDfgetmlen, CMDcategory, CMDsetdtime
	documentation ic35sync.txt:
	- marked uncertain topics with "???"
	- experiments found new commands: read record by record-ID (01 05) and
	  write record data update (01 09), keeps recID on IC35 unchanged
	- new knowledge about open file, changeflag, write record
	  first all read then write,del,commit, "date+time" may be any string
	todo: ic35sync commands import,sync

2000-12-01	version 1.11	IC35SYNC-1-11	(not released to public)
	intermediate freeze after ic35sync import,sync step-1 done:
	- new functions: set_date_time, category, get_mod_flen, read_mod_frec,
	  write_frec, delete_frec, commit_frec
	- IC35 record access functions ic35frec.{c,h}
	- 4byte record-ID combined from file-id (MSB) and record-id (LSW)
	- support last-modified-time for vCard,vCalendar
	- protocol-analyser ic35log.sh replaces and extends ic35prot.awk
	todo: test new funcs, vCard,vCal to IC35 record, commands import,sync

2000-11-22	version 1.10	IC35SYNC-1-10
	- ic35sync supports output IC35 PIM data in vCard,vCalendar format
	  new option "-f format" and command,pimfile args replace "-o outfile"
	  write date+time to logfile
	- added vCard,vCalendar API: vcc.h vcc.y vobject.h vobject.c port.h
	  from gnome-pim-1.2.0.tar.gz:gnome-pim-1.2.0/libversit/
	  see ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnome-pim/
	  other sources for vCard,vCalendar API:
	  - kpilot_3.1.10-1.0.tar.gz (based on KPilot 3.1b9)
	    from ftp://kde.tdyc.com/pub/kde/debian/dists/potato/contrib/source/
	    see also http://www.slac.com/pilone/kpilot_home/index.html
	  - versit consortium' SDK for Windows DLLs
	    from http://www.imc.org/pdi/sdkdllsr.zip
	- restrictions of implemented vCard,vCalendar output:
	  - strings with non-printable chars get "QUOTED-PRINTABLE" property
	    uncertain if it should be "ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE"
	  - strings with 8bit-chars also get "CHARSET=ISO-8859-1" property
	    uncertain if this is compliant to standard, because vobject.h
	    does not contain "CHARSET", but both "vCard Version 2.1" and
	    "vCalendar Version 1.0" explicitely allow "Character Set"
	  - IC35 "Memo" has no standard vCard,vCalendar format representation
	    using proprietary extension of VMEMO records
	- new vcaconv: vCard,vCalendar conversions, e.g. for offline tests
	  with IC35 binary data
	  moved IC35 file descriptions from syntrans.* to dataio.*
	  to avoid vcaconv link needing syntrans.o,synproto.o etc.
	- ic35sync.txt: corrected LED-,Beep-alarmflags
	- Makefile: ask before overwrite distribution tar.gz
	- syntrans.c: reset serial device on abort with Ctrl-C
	- comio.c: correct comrecv(): fdsets undefined if select() returns -1
	- avoid gcc warnings about rcsid[]s not used

2000-11-19	version 1.9	IC35SYNC-1-9	(not released to public)
	- added README, ic35sync.txt,ic35mgr.txt, ic35prot.awk
	- Makefile: integrated help, target for tar.gz distribution
	- syntrans.{c,h},ic35sync.c: export connect(), details internal
	  abort on bad power and wrong password responses
	  check for ready-reponse '\x80' from IC35
	- ic35sync.c: write ic35sync version/rcsid to logfile
	- util.{c,h}: log_init() interface changed (loglevel argument)
	- ic35sync.txt: mention logfiles used for protocol analysis

2000-11-07	version 1.8	IC35SYNC-1-8	(not released to public)
	ic35sync.c split into modules

2000-11-05	version 1.7	IC35SYNC-1-7
	first usable version, read PIM data from IC35 tested OK.
	CAVEAT:
	- PIM data export in "home grown" format not compatible to anything
	- cannot write PIM data to IC35, neither synchronize
	- unsupported commands "set date+time", "category", "reset chgflag"
	- ugly one-module-source

2000-11-04	version 1.1
